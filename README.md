## About OpenVAMS

Open Virtual Airline Management System (OpenVAMS) is an fully open source project that was build on top of the awesome [Laravel Web Framework](https://laravel.com) with the task of making an easily extensible Virtual Airline Manager that is User and Admin friendly. It comes packed with everything that a Virtual Airline needs, ranging from a booking interface, over an easy to use API for developers and it's very own ACARS software, [FlyACARS](https://github.com/Kejax/FlyACARS)

- Great User Interface
- Easy to use Admin Panel
- Powerful [RESTful API](#rest-api) for developers
- Ability to be extended by [modules]
- Own, Open Source ACARS Software [FlyACARS](https://github.com/Kejax/FlyACARS)

## REST API

OpenVAMS comes packed with a powerful REST API that gives you the ability to develop your own tools for your Virtual Airline, or for the community.

The REST API is able to modify the panels data in any way possible, giving you the possibility to create your own software for creating a management panel or to embed it into your website to show current flights.
Check out [example link here](http://example.com/api) for a detailed look

## Modules

When using an Virtual Airline Manager you get to the point where you think of features that are not included with it. OpenVAMS gives you the possibility to add such things by providing a module system, commonly known as "Plugins"

Modules for OpenVAMS are utilising the [laravel-modules](https://example.com) **TODO: INSERT LINK** package, that makes creating modules quite easy. It gives you the possibility to use the whole feature-rich ecosystem that Laravel offers you.

Check out the [documentation](https://example.com) **TODO: INSERT LINK**  for a quick example and basics.
